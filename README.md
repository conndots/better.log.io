better.log.io
===========
A node service to tail log file in realtime via socket.io. Comparing to log.io, it doesn't keep monitoring the change of the log file and tail the changes on demand.    
I implement it by copying the front end UI component of log.io but better.log.io has much differences with log.io in the design and the implementation in the backend.
